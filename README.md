# calculator

This is the third project for The_Odin_Project.

I started by creating a base format for the calculator and wrote some basic javascript functions to be tied into the buttons. I know that my javascript is probably very messy and I would love some advice on how to clean it up. 

## Functions 
1. All buttons work and remember past inputs
2. You are able to use a solution towards a future problem
3. Handles decimal numbers 

## Current Bugs 
1. The calculator doesn't properly take into account PEMDAS 
2. The error message isn't properly showing when you hit equals too early
3. I'm trying to have it only use decimal places when it needs to instead of every time
